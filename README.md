# ENOMOTO Tracking System
**Enomoto Tracking System** is a web platform built in Django that helps you manage different kinds of data adquisition from a number of vehicles. The most basic usage is to track the geoposition of Trucks (as it was intended in version 0.1), however, the system can record different information of your vehicles (those available in an OBD-II communication scheme) and intelligently advice you in actions to take.

## Test
The system is currently live [here](http://ennen.org), or you can deploy it using *Nginx* as a reverse proxy on a *UWSGI* web server.
